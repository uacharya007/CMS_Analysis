# CMS_Analysis
Analysis codes for the low pile up JEC/JER studies.
jec_dijet_data_simu_diff.C -> For different alpha conditions, this code plots asymmetry distribution for different pT ranges and within different eta region in data and simulation. Afterward extract response as function of eta for different pT ranges for each alpha conditions. The pT ranges are specified according to the HTL trigger cuts. The ratio of response between MC/Data vs eta is plotted for different pT range and save them as histograms in the root file for each alpha conditions.
